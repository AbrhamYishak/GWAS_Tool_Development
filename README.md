Here’s a clean, professional **README.md** you can use for your **GWAS Tool Development – Assignment** project:

```markdown
# GWAS Tool Development – Assignment

This repository contains five Galaxy tools written in **XML + Python** that together form a simplified Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) analysis workflow.  
All tools are designed to run on synthetic GWAS-style datasets generated by the included script.

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

1. **SNP & Sample QC**  
   Filters genotype data based on **MAF** and **missingness thresholds**.  
   - Outputs: filtered genotypes, SNP annotation, sample list, QC report.

2. **Allele Frequency Calculator**  
   Computes **allele counts** and **MAF** for each SNP.  
   - Outputs: TSV with SNP ID, chrom, pos, genotype counts, MAF.

3. **Association Test (Logistic Regression)**  
   Performs SNP-by-SNP logistic regression:  
   `phenotype ~ genotype + covariates`.  
   - Outputs: association results (beta, SE, z, p-value, MAF).

4. **Manhattan Plot Generator**  
   Generates a Manhattan plot from association results and extracts top hits.  
   - Outputs: PNG Manhattan plot, TSV of top N SNPs.

5. **Windowed LD Calculator**  
   Computes **pairwise LD (r²)** around a focal SNP within a genomic window.  
   - Outputs: LD matrix TSV, heatmap PNG.

## 📊 Data Preparation

Synthetic GWAS data can be generated with:

```bash
python generate_gwas_data.py
````

This will create a `gwas_data/` folder containing:

* `genotypes.tsv` – Genotype matrix (samples × SNPs)
* `phenotypes_covariates.tsv` – Phenotype + covariates (age, sex)
* `snp_annotation.tsv` – SNP info (chrom, position, MAF)

---

## ▶️ Example Usage

Each tool can be tested **standalone** (outside Galaxy).
For example:

```bash
# Tool 1: SNP & Sample QC
python tools/tool1_snp_sample_qc/snp_sample_qc.py \
    --genotypes gwas_data/genotypes.tsv \
    --snp_annotation gwas_data/snp_annotation.tsv \
    --phenotypes gwas_data/phenotypes_covariates.tsv \
    --maf_threshold 0.01 \
    --snp_missingness_threshold 0.05 \
    --sample_missingness_threshold 0.1
```

```bash
# Tool 2: Allele Frequency Calculator
python tools/tool2_allele_freq/allele_freq.py \
    --genotypes gwas_data/genotypes.tsv \
    --snp_annotation gwas_data/snp_annotation.tsv
```

(Similar commands for Tools 3–5 are documented in their respective READMEs.)

## ⚙️ Dependencies

The following Python libraries are allowed/required:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`
* `statsmodels` (optional)

---

## 📦 Submission Contents

* **tools/** – Five Galaxy tools (XML wrapper + Python script + tool README)
* **sample\_outputs/** – Example output files from testing each tool
* **run\_log.txt** – Command history and notes during testing
* **generate\_gwas\_data.py** – Script to create synthetic GWAS dataset

---

## 📝 Notes

* Each tool includes a `<help>` section in the Galaxy XML wrapper.
* Processing time is short (few minutes on synthetic dataset).
* Outputs are labeled clearly for downstream integration.
* Tools are designed to run both **inside Galaxy** and **standalone**.

Would you like me to also create **individual README.md templates for each tool (Tool 1–5)**, or just keep this as the main project-level README?
